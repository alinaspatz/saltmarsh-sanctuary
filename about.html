               Salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems that provide critical habitats for many species of birds, fish, and other wildlife, serve as a buffer against storms and flooding, and filter pollutants from runoff. They play a key role in carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and provide food sources for local communities. <br> <br>Unfortunately, salt marshes are being destroyed by land development and sea level rise, which causes marshes to decompose and subside, leading to their eventual death. Thankfully, though, we can protect and restore these salt marshes by planting new salt marsh vegetation in areas that have been degraded. <br><br>The Salt Marsh Sanctuary is an interactive and educational website that allows people to digitally grow their own salt marshes and encourages donations to save real-life salt marshes. With every virtual plant, one dollar is counted to save 1 sqft of salt marsh in Rhode Island.

                    Salt marsh plants are uniquely adapted to the challenging conditions of the salt marsh ecosystem. They are able to tolerate high levels of salt in the soil and water and thrive in the frequently flooded marsh conditions. They provide habitat and food for wildlife and play a critical role in stabilizing the marsh ecosystem. Salt marsh plants' roots hold soil in place, prevent erosion, and contribute to sediment buildup.<br><br>

Because salt marshes are so important for the health of coastal ecosystems, preservation and restoration of salt marsh plant species is critical. Loss of these plants can have detrimental effects on the entire ecosystem, including the loss of habitat for wildlife and reduced protection against storms and flooding.
